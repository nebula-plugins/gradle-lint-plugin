## Purpose

The Gradle Lint plugin is a pluggable and configurable linter tool for identifying and reporting on patterns of misuse or deprecations in Gradle scripts and related files.  It is inspired by the excellent ESLint tool for Javascript and by the formatting in NPM's [eslint-friendly-formatter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-friendly-formatter) package.

It assists a centralized build tools team in gently introducing and maintaining a standard build script style across their organization.

## Getting Started

Read the [full documentation](https://github.com/nebula-plugins/gradle-lint-plugin/wiki).

To apply this plugin, please get the latest version from the [Gradle plugin portal](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/nebula.lint) and add the following to `build.gradle`:

```groovy
buildscript { repositories { mavenCentral() } }
plugins {
  id 'nebula.lint' version '<latest version from the Gradle plugin portal>'
}
```

*Important:* For now, in a multi-module build you **must** apply lint to the root project, at a minimum.

Alternatively:

```groovy
buildscript {
  repositories { mavenCentral() }
  dependencies {
    classpath 'com.netflix.nebula:gradle-lint-plugin:latest.release'
  }
}


apply plugin: 'nebula.lint'
```

Define which rules you would like to lint against:

```groovy
gradleLint.rules = ['all-dependency'] // add as many rules here as you'd like
```

For an enterprise build, we recommend defining the lint rules in a `init.gradle` script or in a gradle script that is included via the Gradle `apply from` mechanism.

For multimodule projects, we recommend applying the plugin in an allprojects block:

```groovy
allprojects {
  apply plugin: 'nebula.lint'
  gradleLint.rules = ['all-dependency'] // add as many rules here as you'd like
}
```
## api/implementation support

[v15.0.0](https://github.com/nebula-plugins/gradle-lint-plugin/releases/tag/v15.0.0)  introduced api/implementation configuration support.

This allows to show warnings around api/implementation configurations

Since we need to do some major work to keep track of declared configurations and then replace code with the proper configuration, we decided to just show warnings for now.

This work includes finding dependency information for non resolvable configurations so we look into the parents

If [gradle/gradle#11106](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/11106) lands some day, we could definitely enhance this experience.

While it is great to have automatic fix, not having it is worse. So for now warning about this with the same detail as before is much better than a broken experience with new gradle configurations

## Warning

Gradle Lint Plugin currently doesn't support:

* kotlin build scripts. Please, switch to groovy build script if you want to use linting. [#166](https://github.com/nebula-plugins/gradle-lint-plugin/issues/166)
